# Queue Waiter

- Wait out server queues while you are away (You need to join one time only to initialize the client)
- There is no need to enter email and password as it uses MSA authentication and the server automatically gets your username on connection to the proxy

## Installation

```bash
  npm Install
  node .
```

# Authentication

- The tool uses Microsoft Authentication (MSA) for a secure login process. This means you won't have to provide your email and password.
- You may be asked to visit [microsoft.com](https://microsoft.com/link) and enter the **authentication** code provided in the console in order to authenticate.
